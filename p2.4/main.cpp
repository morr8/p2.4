/*
 ••• P2.4
 Write a program that helps a person decide whether to buy a hybrid car. Your program’s inputs should be:
 
 •The cost of a new car
 
 •The estimated miles driven per year
 •The estimated gas price
 •The estimated resale value after 5 years
 Compute the total cost of owning the car for 5 years. (For simplicity, we will not take the cost of financing into account.) Obtain realistic prices for a new and used hybrid and a comparable car from the Web. Run your program twice, using today’s gas price and 15,000 miles per year. Include pseudocode and the program runs with your assignment.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Enter cost of a new car: ";
    float new_car_price;
    cin >> new_car_price;
    
    cout << "Enter amount of miles driven per year: ";
    float mpy; //miles per year
    cin >> mpy;
    
    cout << "Enter estimated resale value after 5 years: ";
    float resell_value;
    cin >> resell_value;
    
    cout << "Enter todays gas price: ";
    float gas_price;
    cin >> gas_price;
